# AestheticTerrain

A simple vaporwave inspired image generator written in C#.

The project root directory is `AestheticTerrain`, it contains the Visual Studio files, and the actual source code.
The `Build` directory contains a (hopefully) functional build with all required assets needed to run the program.
The `Docs` directory contains the User and Programmer documentation along with a few showcase images.

In case you find any bugs in the software, please create an issue.
I'm unfortunately unable to take any pull requests at the moment.

The program is not fully completed yet, there are still a few features missing, mainly:
- Terrain radius(how many squares are generated in each direction from the viewer)
- Top menu bar doesn't do anything
- Robust logging
- User defined colour LERP directions
- Documentation is fairly sparse
- BFU installer
